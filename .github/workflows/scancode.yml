# Reusable workflow to call scancode action to scan licenses and copyrights and
# upload the results.
#
# Example usage:
#   name: scancode
#
#   on:
#     workflow_dispatch:
#       inputs:
#         branch:
#           description: 'branch'
#           required: false
#           type: 'string'
#           default: 'main'
#
#   permissions:
#     contents: 'read'
#
#   jobs:
#     scancode:
#       uses: 'abcxyz/actions/.github/workflows/scancode.yml@main' # pin tag or sha here.
#       with:
#         branch: '${{ inputs.branch }}'
#
# After install the workflow in your repository, to scan both the repository and
# all transitive dependencies:
#   1, checkout a branch to include the dependencies (i.e. run `go mod vendor`
#   for Go) and push the change.
#   2, use the branch in 1 as the input branch and run the workflow follow
#   https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow.
# To download the results, follow https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts.
