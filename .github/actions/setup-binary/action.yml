name: 'Setup Binary'

description: |-
  Use this action to install and cache a binary for use within a GitHub workflow. This action wraps the functionality of go-getter to provide advanced download and checksum capabilities.

inputs:
  download_url:
    description: 'The download URL for the binary. This must a valid go-getter URL. See https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#url-format'
    required: true
  install_path:
    description: 'The path on disk in which to extract the binary, this cannot be equal to the current directory. Set `add_to_path` to true to add this to the $PATH.'
    required: true
  binary_subpath:
    description: 'The subpath to the binary relative to the install path. This should include the binary name (e.g. dist/binary-name). Required to set the binary as executable and for renaming.'
    required: true
  checksum:
    description: 'The checksum for the downloaded artifact. See https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#checksumming'
    required: false
  cache_key:
    description: 'The cache key to use when caching the downloaded binary. If this value is empty, caching will be disabled.'
    required: false
  add_to_path:
    description: 'Add the install_path to the $PATH variable.'
    default: 'false'
    required: false
  destination_subpath:
    description: 'The destination subpath of the binary relative to the install path. This should include the binary name (e.g. dist/binary-name) and is useful for renaming the binary after download.'
    required: false
