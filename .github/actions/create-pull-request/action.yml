# This action is required to generate a pull request with signed commits using a bot or PAT
# This is required to allow automation to pass organizational rulesets which include signed commits.
# The commits will show signed by github.com.
#
# Alternatives to this solution were deemed infeasible:
#  - Add exceptions for bots to the signed commits rulesets or use a certificate per bot identity, this is
#    not ideal because then we have to maange secrets
#  - Add exceptions for bots to the Google CLA, this would show status checks as failed which is not desirable
